<h1> Bookie </h1>

<p>This project is a bookkeeping system designed for small businesses to keep track of expenses, client accounts, and revenue. It is currently running on EasyGui</p>
<hr>
<p>This program is useful as a learning tool for myself and my students, on the basic uses of databases and the Python language in general.</p>

<h1>If you would like to contribute</h1>
<p> I wouldn't mind having the code cleaned up a bit, making it more efficient.</p>
