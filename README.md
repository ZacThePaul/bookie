<p>This project is a bookkeeping system designed for small businesses to keep track of expenses, client accounts, and revenue. At the moment, it only runs in console, but I have plans to move it to a GUI.</p>
<hr>
<p>This program is useful as a learning tool for myself and my students, on the basic uses of databases and the Python language in general.</p>

<h1>If you would like to contribute</h1>
<p>I would really like this to be turned into a GUI using PyQT5. I will get to it eventually, but if it's not updated here, I haven't done it.</p>

<h1>If you don't understand something</h1>
<p>Please email me at thevalleycodes@gmail.com and I will assist you. Feel free to ask anything.</p>
